🎤 Pitch Summary (for DMs, Twitter, etc.)
Most small creators and solopreneurs use WhatsApp for business, but lose track of leads.
I'm building a tool that auto-captures every lead who DMs you, tracks where they came from, and lets you tag/follow-up easily.
Works beautifully with Instagram, Razorpay, Forms, etc.
No CRM headaches. Just leads that convert.

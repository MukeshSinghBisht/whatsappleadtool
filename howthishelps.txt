Let’s break down how your WhatsApp Lead Tool helps your customers, especially solopreneurs, creators, and small business owners in India who rely heavily on WhatsApp for business.

🧠 The Core Problem They Face
Most small business owners, tutors, freelancers, creators, and sellers use WhatsApp to interact with leads. But they face issues like:

Problem	Pain It Causes
Leads from WhatsApp chats are unorganized	They lose track of leads, forget follow-ups.
No easy way to capture leads with context	People message “Hi” and drop off. No idea where they came from.
No analytics	They don't know which posts/ads worked.
No integration with forms or tools	Leads from Google Forms, Razorpay, etc., don’t flow into one place.

✅ How Your Tool Helps
🟢 1. Creates Custom WhatsApp Lead Links
✅ Generates links like: https://wa.me/91XXXXXXXXXX?text=Hi! I'm interested in your music class.

✅ These links can be shared on YouTube, Instagram, WhatsApp status, etc.

✅ Captures who clicked which link, and what message they sent.

🟢 2. Captures & Stores Leads in a Dashboard
✅ Every lead message is saved with:

Name (if provided)

Phone number

Message

Timestamp

✅ Helps in lead tracking, follow-ups, and reducing lead loss.

🟢 3. Tagging & Filters (upcoming)
✅ Tag leads as hot, interested, not now.

✅ Filter leads for follow-ups.

🟢 4. Webhook Support (upcoming)
✅ Capture leads from Razorpay, Google Forms, Notion Forms, etc.

✅ Unify all leads — WhatsApp or not — into one place.

🟢 5. Export to CSV
✅ Useful for bulk follow-ups or uploading into CRM tools.

✅ Optional, but helpful for businesses scaling up.

🟢 6. DLQ + Retry Mechanism (backend reliability)
✅ For devs or power users, failed messages don’t get lost.

✅ They can retry processing from DLQ (Dead Letter Queue).

💡 Simple Use Case Example
"Rekha teaches dance classes via WhatsApp"

She shares a WhatsApp link on her Instagram bio.

12 people click and message her.

Your tool saves all those messages.

She tags 5 of them as “Hot Leads”.

She follows up tomorrow, closes 3 clients.
